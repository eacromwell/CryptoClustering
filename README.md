# CryptoClustering
Module 19 Challenge | Evan Cromwell | Denver University Data Analytics Bootcamp

## In this challenge, youâ€™ll use your knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

### First, the data is prepared and normalized, then the data is processed using Kmeans. The data is compared at the outset of the challenge, comparing the original analysis and PCA.
